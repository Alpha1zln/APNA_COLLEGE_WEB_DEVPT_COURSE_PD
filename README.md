B- Open folder , Create folder with new proj name and start working    
    once part / full proj work is done, follow below steps to push code on github.  

1. Check where you are  
```git status```
(Just to confirm repo is there and you’re on the default branch, usually main or master.)  

2. Create a new branch  
``` git checkout -b my-feature-branch ```
(or any branch name you like, e.g. backend-mini-proj)

``` git add . ```
